## How to load samples
The Sampler from ToneJS requires a web-accessible audio file. For this project the [Virtual Orchestra](http://virtualplaying.com/virtual-playing-orchestra/) samples have been used,
of which a selection is hosted on this project's Github Pages. Github Pages are required as regular Github-hosted files cannot be fetched due to CORS.
