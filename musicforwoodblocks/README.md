# Music for Pieces of Wood
Rendition of Steve Reich's "Music for Pieces of Wood". Very much WIP.

## How to run
The web page can be served using Vite.
1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2. Run a dev version using `npm run dev`.
3. Navigate your browser to `http://localhost:5173`.

## How to load samples
The Sampler from ToneJS requires a web-accessible audio file. For this project the [Virtual Orchestra](http://virtualplaying.com/virtual-playing-orchestra/) samples have been used,
of which a selection is hosted on this project's Github Pages. Github Pages are required as regular Github-hosted files cannot be fetched due to CORS.
